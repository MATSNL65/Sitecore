# About

I will give an example of refactoring a static responsive website into an existing Sitecore MVC system.

*   I will use [Sitecore 8](http://www.sitecore.net/ "sitecore") with MVC.
*   I will use [Creative Bootstrap theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/ "theme link") for the static responsive website.
